This project will focus on Haskell and Prolog, with an emphasis on Haskell.

The first project is to practice and assess the understanding of functional programming and Haskell. The code is written to implement the guessing part of a logical guessing game -- [The Game of ChordProbe](https://github.com/gaoxiangyu369/Declarative_Programming/tree/master/Haskell_The_Game_of_ChordProbe).

The second project is to practice and assess the understanding of logic programming and Prolog. The code is written to solve Maths Puzzles.
